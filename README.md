Romeo and Juliet Word Analysis Final Project

Description: This is the code used to analyze Romeo and Juliet and the frequency with which both of them speak in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet as part of HLI 331 Shakespeare in the Spring of 2025.

Methodology: In order to better understand both character's speech patterns, I took each of their dialogue from each of the scenes they speak in and added it to a .txt file. This gave me only Romeo's dialogue or only Juliet's dialogue separated by scene. In the style of the 'Word Smith' program used by Kytö I cut out the words "and", "the", "to", "for", "in", "of", "a", "is","that","this","it" from my analysis, as common words hurt the analysis of style and took away from nouns and adjectives. I also generally cut words that were only used once in a scene purely in the interest of aestetics for the graph. I then used the library Natural Language Processing Toolkit (https://www.nltk.org/_) to analyze how subjective or polar each of their monologues were. 

This work was inspired by: Kytö, Merja, Ulla Melander Marttala, and Carin Östman.
